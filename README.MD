## Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK
- Docker Desktop
- Visual Studio 2022 or later (recommended)

## Installation

1. Install the template:

```bash
dotnet new install SenRecep.Aspire
```

2. Create a new project:

```bash
mkdir YourProjectName
cd YourProjectName
dotnet new aspire-microservice-starter -n YourProjectName
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the solution directory
3. Run the application:

```bash
cd source/src/Host/YourProjectName.AppHost
dotnet run
```

## Development Environment

The template uses .NET Aspire's orchestration to manage:

- PostgreSQL databases for each service
- Redis cache
- RabbitMQ message broker
- Seq for centralized logging
- Keycloak for authentication

## Architecture

This template follows Clean Architecture principles with a domain-driven design approach:

- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and business rules
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns and implementations
- **Presentation Layer**: API endpoints and controllers

## Configuration

The template uses centralized package management through `Directory.Packages.props` and shared build properties in `Directory.Build.props`.
